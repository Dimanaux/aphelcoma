# An agent defines the environment in which your code runs.
# It is a combination of one of available machine types and operating

# Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or more jobs. Jobs define the
# commands to execute.

          # job is to work with your code.
          # Optionally you may use --use-cache flag to avoid roundtrip to
          # remote repository.
